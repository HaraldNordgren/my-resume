I am a passionate programmer who has been writing code for over ten years. I love media technology and I am currently writing my master's thesis in the area of video compression.

I am a high-achieving university student with an active interest in mathematics. I tailored the last two years of my education to be able to write as much code as possible and I have knowledge in areas like natural language processing, real-time programming, computer security, advanced algorithm design, assembler and functional programming.

I enjoy using a multitude of languages. Python is my go-to language for any high-level task. I just love how flexible it is and that the syntax almost looks like plain English. C\texttt{++} and Java are great companions because of the wealth of available libraries. I also have experience with low-level C; writing malloc/free from scratch, implementing my own shell and manipulating video bitstreams.

I like to use Perl for regex and string manipulation, and I have written a few Chrome extensions in JavaScript. I like to use several languages for the projects and then glue the pieces together. For example, this document was written in LaTeX and compiled using a Bash script.

I use Ubuntu as my main operating system and I have been doing so for many years. I just love the Unix terminal and I often spend my spare time writing shell scripts to automate all kinds of tasks; extracting segments from a media file using ffmpeg, splitting a git repository in two or setting background images for the terminal window.

I have been an active member on Rateyourmusic.com for many years, contributing to the their database. I wrote a Python script that scrapes album data from a Bandcamp page, formats it and automatically navigates RYM to add the album by filling in textboxes and uploading the cover art. The script also pulls data from Spotify's API.

I am a self-starter who likes personal responsibility and I take pride in writing clear and effective code. I know how to work independently -- how to use Google and Stack Overflow to my advantage -- as well as working within a group. I am a social person that thrives in the company of others. I love to travel and would like to pursue an international career at some point in the future.

Thanks for your time, I look forward to hearing back from you soon.
