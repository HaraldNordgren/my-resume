I am a passionate programmer who has been writing code for over ten years. I work with media asset management at Cantemo and I wrote my master's thesis in the area of video compression.

I am a self-starter who likes personal responsibility and I take pride in writing clear and effective code. I know how to work independently -- how to use Google and Stack Overflow to my advantage -- as well as working within a team. I am a social person that thrives in the company of others, I love to travel I am now taking the first steps in pursuing an international career.

I enjoy using a multitude of languages. Python is my go-to language for any high-level task. I just love how flexible it is and that the syntax reads like plain English. C\texttt{++} and Java are great companions because of the wealth of available libraries. I have experience with low-level C; writing malloc/free from scratch, implementing my own shell and manipulating video bitstreams.

I like to use Perl for regex and string manipulation, and I have written a few Chrome extensions in JavaScript. I like to use several languages for the projects and then glue the pieces together.

I have been a Unix user for many years. Ubuntu for many years and the OS X. I love the terminal and spend my spare time writing shell scripts for all kinds of tasks; extracting segments from a media file using ffmpeg, splitting a git repository in two or setting the background image for the terminal window.

As a student I was a high-achieving, with an active interest in mathematics. I tailored my education to write as much code as possible and I have knowledge about functional languages, assembly, real-time programming, natural language processing, computer security, algorithm design.

I have been an active member on Rateyourmusic.com for many years, contributing to the their database. I wrote a Python script that scrapes album data from a Bandcamp or Sptify, formats it and automatically navigates RYM to add the album by filling in textboxes and uploading the cover art.

Thanks for your time, I look forward to hearing back from you soon.
