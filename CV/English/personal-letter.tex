I am a passionate programmer who has been writing code for over ten years. I love media technology and I am currently writing my master's thesis in the area of video compression.

I am a high-achieving university student with an active interest in mathematics. I have tailored the last two years of my education to be able to write as much code as possible, and I have knowledge in areas like natural language processing, real-time programming, computer security, advanced algorithm design, assembler and functional programming.

I enjoy using a multitude of languages. Python is my go-to language for any high-level task. I just love how flexible it is and that the syntax almost looks like regular English. C\texttt{++} and Java are great companions because of the wealth of available libraries. I also have experience with low-level C; writing malloc/free from scratch, implementing my own shell and manipulating video bitstreams.

I like to use Perl for regex and string manipulation, and I have written a few Chrome extensions in JavaScript. I often use several languages for the same project and then glue the pieces together. For example, this document was written in LaTeX and compiled using a Bash script.

I use Ubuntu as my main operating system and I have been doing so for years. I just love the Unix terminal and I often spend my spare time writing shell scripts for automating all kinds of tasks; extracting segments from a media using ffmpeg, splitting a git repository in two, or setting a background image for the terminal window.

I have been an active member on Rateyourmusic.com for many years, contributing to the their database. I wrote a Python script for scraping album data from Bandcamp, formatting it and then automatically navigating RYM to fill in textboxes and upload cover art. The script also pulls data from Spotify's API.

I am a self-starter who likes personal responsibility. I take pride in writing clear and effective code. I know how to work independently – how to use Google and Stackoverflow to my advantage – as well as working within a group. I am a social person that thrives in the company of others. I love to travel and would like to pursue an international career at some point in the future.

Thanks for your time, I look forward to hearing back from you soon!
